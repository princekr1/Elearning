                            â€œIf you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful.â€�-Jeff Bezos, Founder of Amazon.com

2. â€œI donâ€™t create companies for the sake of creating companies, but to get things done.â€� -Elon Musk, CEO & CTO of SpaceX, Investor in PayPal

3. â€œThe reason it seems that price is all your customers care about is that you havenâ€™t given them anything else to care about.â€�-Seth Godin, American author, entrepreneur, marketer, and public speaker

4. â€œYou canâ€™t just open a website and expect people to flood in. If you really want to succeed you have to create traffic.â€�-Joel Anderson, Walmart CEO

5. â€œIt isnâ€™t just that E-commerce depends on express mail; thereâ€™s a sense in which E-commerce is express mail. Right now, billions of dollars are being spent around the country on so-called â€œlast-mile delivery systems.â€�â€�- Malcolm Gladwell, Journalist, bestselling author, and speaker

6. â€œPeople were doing business with one another through the Internet already, through bulletin boards. But on the Web, we could make it interactive, we could create an auction, we could create a real marketplace. And thatâ€™s really what triggered my imagination, if you will, and thatâ€™s what I did.â€�- Pierre Omidyar, Founder of eBay
